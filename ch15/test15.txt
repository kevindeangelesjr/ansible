Exercise 15-3 Setting Up an Advanced Storage Solution

In this exercise you need to set up a storage solution that meets the following requirements:

• Tasks in this playbook should be executed only on hosts where the device /dev/sdb exists.

• If no device /dev/sdb exists, the playbook should print “device sdb not present” and stop executing tasks on that host.

• Configure the device with one partition that includes all available disk space.

• Create an LVM volume group with the name vgfiles.

• If the volume group is bigger than 5 GB, create an LVM logical volume with the name lvfiles and a size of 6 GB. Note that you must check the LVM volume group size and not the /dev/sdb1 size because in theory you could have multiple block devices in a volume group.

• If the volume group is equal to or smaller than 5 GB, create an LVM logical volume with the name lvfiles and a size of 3 GB.

• Format the volume with the XFS file system.

• Mount it on the /files directory.
