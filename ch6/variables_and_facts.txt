Variable example:
---
- name: create a user using a Variable
  hosts: all
  vars:
    users: lisa
  tasks:
  - name: create a user {{ users }} on hosts {{ ansible_hostname }}
    user:
      name: "{{ users }}"

Entire line that starts with variable must be doubled quoted

Facts: variables that are automatically gathered/set
    all stored in the ansible_facts variable

    ---
    - name: show facts
      hosts: all
      tasks:
      - name: show all facts
        debug:
          var: ansible_facts

    How to address facts:
        {{ ansible_facts['default ipv4']['address'] }} (preferred)
        or
        {{ ansible_facts.default_ipv4.address }}

Custom Facts
    stored on managed hosts at /etc/ansible/facts.d/
    stored in variable ansible_facts.ansible_local
        {{ ansible_facts['ansible_local']['fact_file']['packages']['web_package'] }}
    in ini or json format

        [packages]
        web_package = httpd
        ftp_package = vsftpd
        [services]
        web_service = httpd
        ftp_service = vsftpd

Include files: list variables in separate files

    ---
    - name: using a varaible include file
      hosts: all
      vars_files:
        - vars/common
      tasks:
      ...

host_vars:
    Create directory called host_vars
    In that directory, create a file that mathces the inventory name of the host

group_vars:
    similar approach, call dir group_vars

List/array: Key that has multiple items as a value
    Each item starts with a dash
    Items in list can be addressed using number
        {{ users[1] }}
    Example:

        users:
          - linda:
            username: linda
            homedir: /home/linda
            shell: /bin/bash
          - lisa:
            username: lisa
            homedir: /home/lisa
            shell: /bin/bash
          - anna:
            username: anna
            homedir: /home/anna
            shell: /bin/bash

        Example use in playbook:
        
        tasks:
        - name: Print list values
          debug:
            msg: "User {{ users['linda']['username'] }} has home directory {{ users['linda']['homedir'] }}"

Dictionary: alternative notation to arrays, not often used

Ansible vault: encrypt/decrypt sensitive data
    Encrypt variable file using ansible-vault command
        ansible-vault create secret.yml (new file)
        ansible-vault encrypt (existing file)
    Using in playbook:
        --vault-id @prompt 
        This prompts for password
        or
        --ask-vault-pass

Store results of command in variable: user register
    ---
    - name: test register
      hosts: client1
      tasks:
      - shell: cat /etc/passwd
        register: passwd_contents
      - debug:
          var: "passwd_contents"
