user and group modules:
    ---
    - name: creating a user and group
    hosts: ansible2
    tasks:
    - name: setup the group account
        group:
        name: students
        state: present
    - name: setup the user account
        user:
        name: anna
        create_home: yes
        groups: wheel,students
        append: yes
        generate_ssh_key: yes
        ssh_key_bits: 2048
        ssh_key_file: .ssh/id_rsa


Set variable to the contents of a file (use lookup plugin):
    ---
    - name: simple demo with the lookup plugin
    hosts: localhost
    vars: 
        file_contents: "{{lookup('file', '/etc/hosts')}}"
    tasks:
    - debug:
        var: file_contents


SSH Key management:
    ---
    - name: authorized_key simple demo
    hosts: ansible2
    tasks:
    - name: copy authorized key for ansible user
      authorized_key: 
        user: ansible
        state: present
        key: "{{ lookup('file', '/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"


Generate SSH key:
    - name: create the local user and an SSH key
      user:
        name: "{{ username }}"
        generate_ssh_key: true
        ssh_key_comment: "{{ username }}@{{ ansible_fqdn }}"

    Now, copy file to project directory so it can be copied to the remote host
    - name: create a directory to store the file
      file:
        name: "{{ username }}"
        state: directory
    - name: copy the local user ssh key to temporary {{ username }} key
      shell: 'cat /home/{{ username }}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > {{ username }}/id_rsa.pub'


Generate encrypted password:
    ---
    - name: create user with encrypted pass
    hosts: ansible2
    vars_prompt:
    - name: passw
        prompt: which password do you want to use
    vars:
        user: sharon
    tasks:
    - debug: 
        msg: "{{ '{{ passw }}' | password_hash('sha512','myrandomsalt') }}"
        register: mypass
    - debug:
        var: mypass
    - name: create the user
        user: 
        name: "{{ user }}"
        password: "{{ mypass.msg }}"
