LAB 12-1

Configure the client1 host as a repository server, according to the following requirements:

• Create a directory with the name /repo, and in that directory copy all packages that have a name starting with nginx.

• Generate the metadata that makes this directory a repository.

• Configure the Apache web server to provide access to the repository server. You just have to make sure that the DocumentRoot in Apache is going to be set to the /repo directory.


LAB 12-2

Write a playbook to configure client2 according to the following requirements:

• client2 can access the repository that was created in Lab 12-1.

• Have the same playbook install the nginx package.

• Do NOT start the service. Use the appropriate module to gather information about the installed nginx package, and let the playbook print a message stating the name of the nginx package as well as the version.
