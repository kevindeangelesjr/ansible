LAB 8-1: GENERATE AN /ETC/HOSTS FILE

Write a playbook that generates an /etc/hosts file on all managed hosts. Apply the following requirements:

• All hosts that are defined in inventory should be added to the /etc/hosts file.


LAB 8-2: MANAGE A VSFTPD SERVICE

Write a playbook that uses at least two plays to install a vsftpd service, configure the vsftpd service using templates, and configure permissions as well as SELinux. Apply the following requirements:

• Install, start, and enable the vsftpd service. Also, open a port in the firewall to make it accessible.

• Use the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf file to generate a template. In this template, you should use the following variables to configure specific settings. Replace these settings with the variables and leave all else unmodified:

• Anonymous_enable: yes

• Local_enable: yes

• Write_enable: yes

• Anon_upload_enable: yes

• Set permissions on the /var/ftp/pub directory to mode 0777.

• Configure the ftpd_anon_write Boolean to allow anonymous user writes.

• Set the public_content_rw_t SELinux context type to the /var/ftp/pub directory.

• If any additional tasks are required to get this done, take care of them.
